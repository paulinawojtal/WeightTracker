# WeightTracker
Application made with cooperation with members of Facebook programming group which I am part of.

Application tasks is to track weight changes in time.

Application gives 2 possibilities:
 - create user be given user name, weight and date of weighing or update existing user
 - show details of certain user - weight and date of weighing
 
 When creating a user, application also creates a file with file name as a user name in which given date and weight is saved.
 When updating, application updates file by appending new given weight and date to file.
